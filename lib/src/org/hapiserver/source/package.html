    <p>A HapiRecordSource is an object which will provide an iterator for the
HAPI records.  This object is queried to see if it supports one query for 
arbitrary time ranges, or if particular intervals should be queried.  For 
example, if the source is based on daily files, then the record source can
implement the iterator for one file, and the server itself will combine
(aggregate) the data.</p>
    <p>A HapiRecord iterator provides each of the records to the server.</p>
